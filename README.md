# DevNotes

A place where I can digitalize my coding notebooks via a Markdown Blog layout

## Goals:

This project will host my notes on different dev topics I learn and find interesting so I can easily go back to them. They will also be available to the public, however, only I will be able to add to my notes via an admin panel utilizing a markdown to react translator.\

What's more _dev_ than developing your own blog-like site from scratch so you can hold host your notes on other developer topics?

## Stack:

Typescript, Go, PostgreSQL
[react to markdown library](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)
